title: About me
---

I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in algorithms and back-end system.

On the side I'm involved in competitive programming, having competed solo as well as in the team <em>Omogen Heap</em>, which won the Nordic programming championships four consecutive years.
I currently organize training camps and competitions in programming and computer security in the organization <a href="https://kodsport.se">Swedish Coding Sports</a>.
