  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
  Currently, I'm a computer science student at KTH. My professional interests are mainly algorithms and back-end systems.

  <p>
  I do a fair bit of competitive programming together with my team <em>Omogen Heap</em>, which won the Nordic programming championships four consecutive years.
  Lately I've mostly been organizing contests, in particular the <a href="http://progolymp.se">Swedish Olympiad in Informatics</a>.

  <p>
  I also organize training camps and other competitions in maths, programming, computer security etc., mostly within the organization <a href="http://ungvetenskapssport.se">Young Science Sports</a>.
